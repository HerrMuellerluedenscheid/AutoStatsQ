# AutoStatsQ
Toolbox for automated station quality control for MT inversion (-work in progress-)

- Catalog search for teleseismic events with uniform azimuthal coverage around array
- Download of data & metadata for these events + computation of synthetic data
- Relative gain factors in time domain (relative to reference station and/or synthetic data)
- Comparison of obs. and synth. PSD; determining frequency ranges suitable for MT inversion
- rayleigh wave polarization analysis for sensor orientations (not yet online)
