Toolbox for automated station quality control for MT inversion (-work in progress-)

- Automatic download of data & metadata for teleseismic events with uniform azimuthal coverage
- Relative gain factors in time domain (relative to reference station and/or synthetic data)
- amplitude spectra (not yet online)
- rayleigh wave polarization analysis for sensor orientations (not yet online)
